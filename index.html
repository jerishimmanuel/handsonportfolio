    <p class="About">I'm a second-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in software development. I have hands-on experience in C and Java, and I'm currently learning Data Structures and full-stack web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

My journey started with a holiday course that sparked my passion for coding. Since then, I’ve built projects, participated in a hackathon, and continued learning through real-world challenges. I aim to become a skilled Software Development Engineer and contribute to impactful tech solutions.</p>
